                    <p class="project-text">The Octo Monster project meant a lot to us, it was our first shot at creating a ground-based enemy in the game. 
                         Figuring out how to make a monster that attacks was tough, so we started by looking into AI systems.
                         It was tricky because of this thing called the ForceSystem (FS), but we kept at it and finally understood how it worked.
                         My colleague Jason Siegersma and I worked well together, with a clear plan outlining our roles. 
                         I was in charge of the animations & unity events, while Jason mainly focused on the code.
                         What was cool is that we switched roles every 1-2 hours, keeping things balanced.
                         Oh, and we worked in sprints of 2 weeks, which helped us stay focused and make progress quickly.
                    </p>

                        <p class="image-title">Each of octo's animations:</p>

                    </div>

                    <p class="project-text">The Octo Monster has four unique states that make it tick. We began by setting up the Pathfinding script, which went pretty smoothly thanks to our grasp of the ForceSystem. We even included a GIF to demonstrate how it all came together.

                    </p>
                    <P>Moving on to the Idle and Detection states was a breeze. However, things got complicated when we delved into Fuzzy and Attacking. We had to call in our Lead Developer, Berend, for assistance. It turned out that triggering Attack and Fuzzy at the same time caused an animator glitch, which you can spot in the upper GIF.
                    </P>
                    <p>The Attacking and Fuzzy States played a vital role in bringing the Octo Monster to life. The Attacking state was all about making the creature come alive during battles, while Fuzzy injected an element of unpredictability into its actions.</p>
                    <P>The incredible visual appeal of the Octo Monster was the handiwork of Alex Kentie, who utilized VFX shaders to highlight its legs. These legs not only bent on their own but were also easy to customize, lending a touch of visual elegance to the Octo.</P>
                    <P>In sum, our journey with the Octo Monster taught us some crucial lessons in game development, especially the significance of teamwork and creative troubleshooting in this thrilling realm.</P>
