                    <h2 class="project-title">Intro</h2>
                    <p class="project-text">The Octo Monster feature meant a lot to us, it was our first shot at creating a ground-based enemy in the game. 
                         Figuring out how to make a monster that attacks was tough, so we started by looking into AI systems.
                         It was tricky because of this thing called the ForceSystem (FS), but we kept at it and finally understood how it worked.
                         My colleague Jason Siegersma and I worked well together, with a clear plan outlining our roles. 
                         I was in charge of the animations & unity events, while Jason mainly focused on the code.
                         What was cool is that we switched roles every 1-2 hours, keeping things balanced.
                         Oh, and we worked in sprints of 2 weeks, which helped us stay focused and make progress quickly.
                    </p>

                            In the gif above you can see Octo's Idle, Walking, Jumping, Attacking & Fuzzy animations!<br>
                            The visuals as well as the animations of this entity are made by Alex Kentie.

                    <h2>Development</h2>
                    <p class="project-text">
                        The Octo Monster operates on 4 unique states that make it function.
                        We began by setting up a new Pathfinding script dedicated to ground units.
                        Which did not go without the neccesairy struggle to make it a generic.

                        Moving on to the Detection state wasn't too difficult.
                        However, things got complicated once we delved into the Fuzzy and Attack States.
                        <br></br>
                        We had to call in our Lead Developer, Berend, for assistance.
                        It turned out that triggering the AttackState caused the DetectionState to be triggered at the same time causing several animation glitches.
                    </p>

                            Simply said, if the direction of your walkForce is negative, update walkForce to positive.<br>
                            Or from positive to negative of course depending on the X-axis' position.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        The Attacking and Fuzzy States played a vital role in bringing the Octo Monster to life.
                        The Attacking state was all about making the creature come alive during battles, while Fuzzy injected an element of unpredictability into its actions.

                    <P class="project-text">The incredible visual appeal of the Octo Monster was the handiwork of Alex Kentie, who utilized VFX shaders to highlight its legs.
                        These legs not only bent on their own but were also easy to customize, lending a touch of visual elegance to the Octo.</P>
                    <P class="project-text">In sum, our journey with the Octo Monster taught us some crucial lessons in game development, especially the significance of teamwork and creative troubleshooting in this thrilling realm.</P>
