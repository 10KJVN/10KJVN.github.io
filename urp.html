                    <p>
                        In this project i was given 8 weeks to pick any software of choice and specialize in it.
                        Since i've already worked with shaders 1 period before this,
                        i thought to myself "Yeah that was cool, i'd love to know more about that."

                                In the first week of this period there was a list of existing user stories for <a href="https://www.neonorigins.com/"target="_blank">Operation Starfall.</a>
                                And of one these user stories said something along the lines of 'I want the game to feel like watching an 80's NTSC TV. 
                                Which of course sounded pretty cool to me, so i picked that user story.

                                I was asked to look for possibilities to create custom overrides for unity's volumes. 
                                So i went on ahead and found out it's pretty simple which led to the creation of 2 scripts.

                                A 'TintRendererFeature' and a 'CustomPostScreenTint'.
                                These two scripts work together to apply the tint to your screen.

                                At the end of the 8 week period i've learned a lot more about render pipelines, 
                                shaders and how they can work together. Which i at first did not have the slightest knowledge about.
                                I was stuck on getting my screen tint to be rendered for 2 weeks straight. 
                                Turns out the issue was i forgot to add my renderer feature, to the renderer. 
                                Since there was nothing dysfunctional about the shaders i've created.
