                <h2>About Expanding Space</h2>
                <p>
                    "Expanding Space" was a collaborative project to develop an engaging game that would inspire space travel and astronomy interest amongst a younger audience.
                    It marked the first partnership between Game Developers and Game Artists, with each group comprising two developers and four artists. 
                    But our group had an extra dev who joined the project at a later date. This was also the second time we worked with sprints if i recall correctly.
                
                    <br></br>
                    Sprint 0: Initial research phase.<br>
                    Sprint 1 and 2: Concentrated on creating a playable game.<br>
                    Sprint 3: Finish & Present the product on a project market.<br>

                <p class="project-text">
                        To start this project off, we as a team were brainstorming about the genre of the game, the gameplay loop, and a goal and such.
                        We decided to do go for a 3D horror game with parkouring and FPS elements. 
                        So the artists went ahead to create their assets and sketches, while i started working on a First Person Camera Controller as seen below.

                        In the snippet above i expanded on a simple script i've learned to make in the math classes of my teacher Jelle. <br>
                        Thanks to those lessons i already knew how to implement mathematical features like 'Mathf.Clamp' for camera related scripts.

                <p class="project-text">
                    After making an inverted Camera Controller script, i continued to think about what would be logical to implement next in our project,
                    and concluded the player doesn't only need to look around but also be able to move around.

                       Here you can see the player jumping from wall to wall. <br>
                       I've also added the possibility to run and slide in case the player engages combat.

                        Here you see the flying entity following the player, shooting bullets targeted at the players position.
                        There were no animations at the time, but with the limited knowledge i had.<br>
                        I managed to make the enemy's orientation work along with the Attacking script.

                <h3 class="project-text">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="project-text">
                    By leveraging Shader Graph, developers can create visually stunning and customizable stamina bars
                    that align with the aesthetic and design requirements of their game, ultimately contributing to a
                    more immersive and engaging gameplay experience for players.
