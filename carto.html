                <p>
                    Vertical Slice is a project in which we had to recreate 10 seconds from a game on a 1:1 scale.
                    It marked the second collaboration between Artists and Developers.

                    In this project i mainly focused on putting together the UI.
                    Together with one of the artists within our team i recreated the UI elements seen in the gameplay footage with 2D Objects.
                    Closely inspecting the assets at <a href="https://www.gameuidatabase.com/gameData.php?id=714">Game UI Database.</a>

                        I've added placeholders for the main UI elements seen in the game.<br>

                <p class="project-text">
                    The development of Carto was a little different than other projects i've worked on since we already have a concrete visual of what we were working to.
                    At the start of the sprint we were brainstorming on the techniques and strategies the original creators may have used to recreate these assets.
                    We searched more gameplay footage of Carto and were excited to recreate other parts of the game,
                    Until we were attended by our teachers that we needed to only focus on the dedicated 10 seconds they've provided to us.

                        My colleagues made the Map Placement class. <br>
                        I made the script for the 'Scope' as i like to call it to change when picking up a map piece. <br>

                        The main Mechanics we've seen off the bat would be difficult to recreate,<br>
                        Due to us not knowing where to start or how they'd function the best.

                <p class="project-text">
                    In The end of this trajectory i learned quite alot about the intricasies of having to pay attention to every little detail provided in these games.
                    And that you can perform all sorts of tricks to make a 2D game in a 3D unity scene for example, we just used camera angles and canvases to make the game appear like its 2 Dimension,
                    While in reality, in our case it isn't.

                        Usually these would be sprites, but i went on ahead and made them myself using only 2D blocks.<br>
                        They also shift from shape whenever a map piece is selected, or spacebar is pressed!
