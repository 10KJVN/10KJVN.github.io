                <h2>About Vertical Slice</h2>
                <p>
                    Vertical Slice is a project in which we had to recreate 10 seconds from a game on a 1:1 scale.
                    It marked the second collaboration between Artists and Developers.

                <p class="project-text">
                    In this project i mainly focused on putting together the UI.
                    Together with one of the artists within our team i recreated the UI elements seen in the gameplay footage with sprites.
                    Closely inspecting the assets seen at <a href="https://www.gameuidatabase.com/gameData.php?id=714" target="_blank">Game UI Database.</a>
                    When initiating the Carto project, our team, one of two groups, deliberated whether to build the scene from a 3D or 2D template.
                    Despite initial discussions, we decided on a 3D approach.
                    Unlike the other group, which started from a 2D template, we creatively simulated certain elements using perspective techniques.

                <p class="project-text">
                    The development of Carto was a little bit different than other projects i've previously worked on.
                    Since we already knew, and had a concrete visual of what we were tasked to create it was pretty straight forward.
                    At least until we've started discussing the technical side of things.
                    <br><br>
                    In the first week we made a trello and wrote down to-do's for each feature.
                    Then we held a stand-up to discuss who's going to be doing what.
                    As seen below, my contributions.

                        Since i was quick to put this together, not yet all art assets were available yet.<br>
                        hencewhy i utilized placeholders or made them myself.

                        Here you see a map piece being rotated.<br>
                        When pressing W, a map piece centers itself inside the scope.
                        It also remains as a child of the map once placed.

                        This is basically the logic behind what u just saw happening in the gif above.<br>
                        The PieceMovement function transforms a map pieces' (A1) position, to the center position.<br>
                        The PieceRotation functions either Add or Subtract a value of 90 to the objects' Z-axis, allowing it to rotate.

                <p class="project-text">
                    After completing the project, we received feedback from our teachers. 
                    While we got positive comments, their main critique highlighted the absence of audioâ€”
                    something we had overlooked. 
                    It made me realize that recreating even a short segment of a game involves more work than it appears on the surface. 
                    Despite the challenge, it was a valuable learning experience.

                    One of the best things i learned from this project is how to improvise when u don't know something.
                    For example, it's not the 'Scope' that moves map pieces around.
                    The map itself is litteraly moving instead.

                        And you've got movement.
