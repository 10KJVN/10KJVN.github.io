                <h2>About Vertical Slice</h2>
                <p>
                    Vertical Slice is a project in which we had to recreate 10 seconds from a game on a 1:1 scale.
                    It marked the second collaboration between Artists and Developers.

                <p class="project-text">
                    In this project i mainly focused on putting together the UI.
                    Together with one of the artists within our team i recreated the UI elements seen in the gameplay footage with sprites.
                    Closely inspecting the assets seen at <a href="https://www.gameuidatabase.com/gameData.php?id=714" target="_blank">Game UI Database.</a>
                    When initiating the Carto project, our team, one of two groups, deliberated whether to build the scene from a 3D or 2D template.
                    Despite initial discussions, we decided on a 3D approach.
                    Unlike the other group, which started from a 2D template, we creatively simulated certain elements using perspective techniques.

                <h2 class="project-text">Development</h2>
                <p class="project-text">
                    The development of Carto was a little bit different than other projects i've previously worked on.
                    Since we already knew, and had a concrete visual of what we were tasked to create it was pretty straight forward.
                    At least until we've started discussing the technical side of things.
                    <br><br>
                    In the first week we made a trello and wrote down to-do's for each feature.
                    Then we held a stand-up to discuss who's going to be doing what.
                    As seen below, i started off with a canvas.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        Since i was quick to put this together, not yet all art assets were available yet.<br>
                        hencewhy i utilized placeholders.

                        The main Mechanics we've seen off the bat would be difficult to recreate,<br>
                        Due to us not knowing where to start or how they'd function the best.

                <h3 class="project-text">Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="project-text">
                    In The end of this trajectory i learned quite alot about the intricasies of having to pay attention to every little detail provided in these games.
                    And that you can perform all sorts of tricks to make a 2D game in a 3D unity scene for example, we just used camera angles and canvases to make the game appear like its 2 Dimension,
                    While in reality, in our case it isn't.

                        Usually these would be sprites, but i went on ahead and made them myself using only 2D blocks.<br>
                        They also shift from shape whenever a map piece is selected, or spacebar is pressed!

                    Even though i haven't really contributed as much as i wished i did in this project i am still proud of the things i have achieved and learned from this project.
