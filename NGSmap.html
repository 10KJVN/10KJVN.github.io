                The overlay map feature was supposed to act as a sort of mini-map to the player(s). 
                Though we didn't get to finish it before our time at Neon Origins was over, it has been yet another great learning experience.
                In this project i learned how to utilize blitting in multiple ways and i've discovered about render textures & blend materials.

            <h2 class="project-text">Development</h2>
            <p class="project-text">
                During the initial design phase of this feature i had just worked on multiple shader related features before this one.
                So i got together with my colleagues to discuss how we were going to handle this from a technical standpoint. 
                <br><br>
                Each of us vaguely knew what had to be done, but which way would be the most effecient? 
                I suggested setting up an extra camera that screenshots the whole map of each level through blitting.
                The only issue with this was, i had no idea how to do this specifically, so i went on ahead and experimented a little.
                <br><br>
                I wrote some throwaway shader code that was supposed to get the Main Camera in the scene as a component,
                then i litteraly wrote 'Camera.Blit' thinking that was a thing. 
                It wasn't so at that point i hit a roadblock in my thinking process due to my limited knowledge at the time.

                <p class="project-text">
                    After a lot of research and brainstorming, we asked our technical director for advice. <br>
                    I explained to him i couldn't find out how to blit a whole level with the camera.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class="image-title">A function derrived from the original Texture Drawer class.</p>

                <p class="project-text">
                    He told me i could possibly draw a texture upon the map itself instead of blitting the level. <br>
                    That's how i found out about render textures and blend materials existance.   
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="project-text">
                Creating a class that uses the draw function from the Texture Drawer, 
                i could now clearly figure out how to create my contribution in this feature.
            </p>
                                <pre>
                                    <code class="snippet">
                                        drawPosition.x += 0.5f;
                                    </code>
                                </pre>   
            <p class="project-text">                    
                This single line of code uses the brush, in this case a custom blit shader to draw at it's destination.
                The blend material in use is a perfect example of an efficient way to achieve what i tried by just using a regular blit.

                <p class="project-text">
                    Since this feature is intended for Operation Starfall i added a placeholder player. <br>
                    I connected the draw function to that player's position and manually moved it during runtime.

            <p class="project-text">
                By leveraging Shader Graph, developers can create visually stunning and customizable stamina bars
                that align with the aesthetic and design requirements of their game, ultimately contributing to a
                more immersive and engaging gameplay experience for players.
