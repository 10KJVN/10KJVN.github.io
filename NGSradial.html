                <p class="project-text">
                    Utilizing a shader for the first time to create a stamina bar in Unity offered me a new perspective.
                    instead of traditional coding approaches, or using UI.
                    Having Shadergraph provide a visual and node-based interface,
                    made it more accessible for developers who did not have any experience with shaders at all.
                    This was an eye opening experience to develop something so visually impressive and functional at the same time,
                    without having to write a single line of code.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Radial Stamina bar serves as a substitute for the previous stamina system due to popular demand
                    within our development team. 
                    The design is inspired by the stamina bar in Zelda Breath of the Wild. 
                    This collaborative project was undertaken in partnership with Jason Siegersma. 
                    Given that the stamina bar makes use of Shadergraph,
                    it resulted in me discovering new potential ways to utilize shaders and their
                    intricacy within a feature like this.

                    Learning Unity shader coding was a real challenge. 
                    At first, I had to grasp the concept of how shaders manipulate graphics.
                    It didn't click at once. Then, I delved into the shader language and its functions, which was like deciphering complex
                    instructions. There were moments of frustration when my shaders didn't work as intended, just like
                    when you hit roadblocks with an assignment. But, with determination and lots of trial and error, I
                    started to understand how to control colors, lighting, and textures. Finally, I realized that
                    shaders were like crafting a unique artistic expression for each object in the game. It was a
                    demanding journey, but in the end, it was incredibly rewarding to see how shaders transformed the
                    visual aspect of the game.

                    <p class="project-text">
                        In the snippet above you can see the code of when the staminabar is depleted and how long it
                        takes to regenerate the stamina back.

                        As seen above the stamina radial goes empty when running and when it hits 0, it plays an
                        animations and then regenerates the stamina back over time.<br>

                <p class="project-text">
                    By leveraging Shader Graph, developers can create visually stunning and customizable stamina bars
                    that align with the aesthetic and design requirements of their game, ultimately contributing to a
                    more immersive and engaging gameplay experience for players.
